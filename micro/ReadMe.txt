This program controls the XPhone. It is an electronic xylophone.
The xylophone records the user's keystrokes and plays them back on a loop.
Check out jensynth.com for more details.


The XPhone program is compiled for (and run on) an STM32 Nucleo development board.
It costs around $20 (in 2017 dollars).
STM32F412 on the Nucleo-F412ZG.
"System Workbench for STM32" is used (which is built around the Eclipse IDE).
The nucleo board can be plugged right into USB, which makes debugging a snap.
